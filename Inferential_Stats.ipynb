    "In Hypothesis testing, we need to have an assumption called the null hypothesis (H0), and the alternative hypothesis (Ha). \n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are always opposite of each other. The hypothesis testing procedure then would use the sample data to determine whether or not the null hypothesis can be rejected or we fail to reject it (which means we accept the alternative hypothesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform a hypothesis testing method to see if the null hypothesis must be rejected, we need to determine the significance level. \n",
    "The level of significance is the type 1 error ( rejecting H0 when H0 is true) maximum probability that is allowed to happen in the test. \n",
    "Usually, the significance level is 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw a conclusion from the sample, hypothesis testing uses the P-value when assuming the null hypothesis is true to measure how likely the sample results are. When the P-value is smaller than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we canâ€™t reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a method that can be performed in any population parameter and could be performed on multiple parameters as well. For example, the below code would perform a t-test on two different populations to see if this data is significantly different than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "st.ttest_ind(tips[tips['sex'] == 'Male']['tip'], tips[tips['sex'] == 'Female']['tip'])\n",
    "\n",
    "Ttest_indResult(statistic=1.387859705421269, pvalue=0.16645623503456755)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In the t-test, we compare the means between two groups (pairwise test). The null hypothesis for the t-test is that there are no differences between the two groups' mean, while the alternative hypothesis is that there are differences between the two groups' mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test result shows that the tip between the Male and Female is not significantly different because the P-value is above 0.05 significance level. \n",
    "It means we failed to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are no differences between the two groups' means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the test above only simplifies the hypothesis testing example. There are many assumptions we need to know when we perform hypothesis testing, and there are many tests that we can do to fulfill our needs. \n"
